1. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Lung Cancer Detection (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/518.pdf).

```
- Uses Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 and LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 datasets.
- Images of 512*512px in dimensions and labeled for presence or absence of cancer.
- Preprocessing - removal of noise from neighbouring tissues, bones and air using segmentation by U-Net, downsampling, normalization. This is done to extract region of interest (cancer nodules).
- Lookup Watershed (segmentation).
```
